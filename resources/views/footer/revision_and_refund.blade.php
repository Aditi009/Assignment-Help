                              Revision & Refund Policy

                         <ol>
                              <li>If you decide to cancel the request before itâ€™s allocation to a writer, you may book
                                   another assignment of the same value, free of cost. In any case, if the writer was
                                   already assigned then your request for refund shall not be processed. This is as per
                                   our writer policy that any writer who begins the task will get the remuneration for
                                   the work assigned.</li>
                              <li>In-case you were charged twice by payment service providers such as (PayPal) for the
                                   same order id, please do get in touch with us with desired payment receipts and we
                                   shall process your refund at the earliest.</li>
                              <li>We always do our best to allocate the best writer for your unique assignment needs but
                                   sometimes due to unforeseen circumstances the desired writers could not be allocated.
                                   In this scenario, you can avail the full refund of your amount or choose any other
                                   assignment task of a similar value.</li>
                              <li>Please make sure that all the requirements are submitted as soon as possible to help
                                   us ensure timely delivery of your work. In the event that all the requirements were
                                   submitted on time, that there were no major modifications in the requirements after
                                   the initial submission and the student was in no way liable for the delay. Our 100%
                                   delivery guarantee policy ensures that the student can accept the assignment by just
                                   paying 50 percent of the total value or ask for a refund of his/her initial payment
                                   if the first draft version of assignment was delivered post the promised delivery
                                   date.</li>
                              <li>The 100% satisfaction policy guarantees that we will continue to accept re-work until
                                   30 days of assignment initial submission date. Post that no re-work or refund of any
                                   sort shall be entertained.</li>
                              <li>In a highly probable condition of 'fail' grade for your submitted assignment, we shall
                                   process a 100% refund once the authentic fail proof has been submitted within 30 days
                                   of assignment delivery date. Any request after this period shall not be entertained.
                              <li>We don't entertain refunds for delays at client's or writer's end. Since it's research
                                   based work, some delays can happen due to complexity of the problem or due to
                                   communication lag between client/writer or due to change in requirements. We expect
                                   our clients to keep some buffer when ordering on our website although we try our best
                                   to deliver the solution as per the client's expected date.
