                              Combating The Odds Of Plagiarism

                         <p class="ft">It may appear to be tempting to submit the tailor-made essays, assignments and research
                              papers as your own; this isn’t how you’re supposed to avail our services. The model
                              academic papers we provide, is meant to be used as a rough draft for further research. You
                              are expected to include your understanding and unique slants in the paper, in order to
                              avoid plagiarism. <br>
                              We respect the academic norms observed by various universities across the globe. However,
                              disregarding the conventions of plagiarism by using the original model paper as it is,
                              will be of no help in the long run. It will prevent you from accumulating the knowledge
                              you need to implement during examinations.

                         <p class="ft">Our model assignment papers are written in order to provide students with an example of how
                              a particular academic question can be managed. However, that doesn’t mean the particular
                              question will only be asked in a similar format. The chances are that you may be asked to
                              come up with a different perspective based on a similar topic. However, the model academic
                              papers will serve the purpose of helping you to form ideas regarding a strong starting
                              point. You can eventually draft your own paper based on extensive research, you may wish
                              to conduct further. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to use our sample papers.</p>

                         <p class="ft">Students, opting for premium service, will receive a call back from the relationship manager
                              within 12 hours of making a request for rework. A dedicated relationship manager treats
                              the task with priority and helps to create a perfect tailor-made assignment. In general
                              cases, students receive a call only if they put in a request for “call back” and the team
                              gets back in 24 hours time.</p>
