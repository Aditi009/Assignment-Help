            <p class="lh-18" style="font-size:15px; font-family: 'q_serif',Georgia,Times,'Times New Roman','Hiragino Kaku Gothic Pro','Meiryo',serif;">In the last decade, computer programming and IT sector has been booming, with the new technological advancement, innovations in consumer electronics,  application of AI in smartphones and other devices and many other new developments which involve computer programming, a large number of students are looking to get programming assignment help with their college and university curriculum. </p>
            
            <p class="lh-18" style="font-size:15px; font-family: 'q_serif',Georgia,Times,'Times New Roman','Hiragino Kaku Gothic Pro','Meiryo',serif;">More and more students are venturing into the world of computer science each day because of the world of possibilities and opportunities it presents before them. A graduate in computer science learns many professional and interpersonal skills which help them become a successful individual in any field which they pursue. This is why a course in computer science has been the most in demand course in the last two decades.  But as there are new technological advancements, and the field of computer sciences is ever expanding, students have to face tough competition and learn a large number of topics and subjects so as to score good marks in their academic courses. </p>
            
            <p class="lh-18" style="font-size:15px; font-family: 'q_serif',Georgia,Times,'Times New Roman','Hiragino Kaku Gothic Pro','Meiryo',serif;"><b>Why students need programming assignment help? </b><br>
            Lack of technical expertise and experience regarding the implementation of the different programming frameworks is one of the main reasons students struggle with their programming assignments. Many students are not able to work the sophisticated tools which they need to use for their assignments. Others even don't have access to those apps. Such students feel as if they are bound to fail unless they get programming assignment help from our experts.
            </p>
            
            <p class="lh-18" style="font-size:15px; font-family: 'q_serif',Georgia,Times,'Times New Roman','Hiragino Kaku Gothic Pro','Meiryo',serif;">Studying any programming language takes a lot of time, which most college and university students do not have. Students have to carve out time to study and do research. It's very challenging for them to allocate their assignments the time necessary due to numerous units students learn in University.</p>
            
            <p class="lh-18" style="font-size:15px; font-family: 'q_serif',Georgia,Times,'Times New Roman','Hiragino Kaku Gothic Pro','Meiryo',serif;">A programming language requires a lot of practice, in order to get used to the various syntax and the common bugs which are faced. Not being able to give sufficient time to the programming language is something which affects most college and university students. Most students overlook the fact that practice makes it perfect, and if you want to learn a new concept then practice is crucial. As long as, one can find time to fully understand the various concepts of programming and practice is regularly, programming assignment will become very easy for them to solve and score good grades. However, those students who struggle with it can get programming assignment help from our expert tutors at a2z assignment help.</p>
            
            <p class="lh-18" style="font-size:15px; font-family: 'q_serif',Georgia,Times,'Times New Roman','Hiragino Kaku Gothic Pro','Meiryo',serif;">In order to learn a programming language, it is necessary to learn the practical as well as the theoretical aspect of things. Most students fail to acknowledge the importance of practical implementation, and focus on mugging up the theoretical concepts. Only by testing out the code practically can students get to fully comprehend the topics which they learn in theory.</p>

            A programming language is a set of instructions and guidelines, using which a machine or a computer works. These instructions have to be formed in such a way that it is easy for a machine to understand and follow it, as each human mind is different , but a machine or computer program must follow a predefined structure so as to work efficiently.  
            </p>
            
            <p class="lh-18" style="font-size:15px; font-family: 'q_serif',Georgia,Times,'Times New Roman','Hiragino Kaku Gothic Pro','Meiryo',serif;">Depending upon the purpose and the type of machine they are being used on, programming languages can be classified into the following categories: </p>
            
            <p class="lh-18" style="font-size:15px; font-family: 'q_serif',Georgia,Times,'Times New Roman','Hiragino Kaku Gothic Pro','Meiryo',serif;"><b>Object Oriented Programming Language</b><br>
            Object-oriented language is a programming language which sees everything as a collection of objects with internal data and portions of that information that are accessed from outside. The main objective of this language of programming is to look at the problem by segmenting it into a group of objects offering services which could be used to overcome a difficult issue. Another key principle of OOP language is encapsulation that, within the object must be everything an object may need. Object oriented programming also demonstrates reusability via inheritance, and the ability to manipulate existing implementations without the use of polymorphism to drastically change a lot of the code. Object oriented program's main objective is to tie the data and the functions that run on them together so that no other section of the program can access such data apart from that function.

            <p class="lh-18" style="font-size:15px; font-family: 'q_serif',Georgia,Times,'Times New Roman','Hiragino Kaku Gothic Pro','Meiryo',serif;">The main characteristic features of object oriented programming are: </p>

            Procedural programming is the very first programming foundation that a new programmer would study. Fundamentally, procedural code is the one that explicitly directs a machine to perform an operation using logical steps. This framework employs a linear methodology from top-down, and views information and protocols as two independent things. Since procedural programming is based on the principle of a procedure call it divides the code into procedures that are sometimes referred to as processes or operations, containing basically a series of actions to be carried out. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="lh-18" style="font-size:15px; font-family: 'q_serif',Georgia,Times,'Times New Roman','Hiragino Kaku Gothic Pro','Meiryo',serif;">Procedural programming can be used to implement a series of assertions that result in a response. Generally, different variables, various loops and other elements are used in this type of language which distinguishes it from functional programming language. Procedural language functions can influence variables, in addition to the value of the function returned.</p>
            
            <p class="lh-18" style="font-size:15px; font-family: 'q_serif',Georgia,Times,'Times New Roman','Hiragino Kaku Gothic Pro','Meiryo',serif;"><b>Functional Programming Language</b><br>
            Functional programming is a programming framework where we attempt to connect everything in the form of purely mathematical functions. Functional programming is a declarative style of programming. The primary objective in this style is "what to fix" as opposed to an imperative approach where "how to fix" a problem is the primary objective. Rather than statements it incorporates expressions. To generate a value an expression is assessed, while a statement is performed to allocate variables. In general, functional programming language uses stored information, often excluding loops in place of repetitive methods. The main objective in functional programming is the return values of methods, therefore side effects and variations indicate that the storage status is strongly opposed.  Nevertheless, it may create algorithmic calls and alter those call parameters. This language makes is fairly easier to identify and solve intangible issues, however, the programming framework of a functional program is quite difficult to understand but it is much easier for the machine to run.

            <p class="lh-18" style="font-size:15px; font-family: 'q_serif',Georgia,Times,'Times New Roman','Hiragino Kaku Gothic Pro','Meiryo',serif;"><b>Scripting Programming Language </b><br>
            Scripting programming is a language which was made to incorporate and interact with other programming languages. Tcl, ASP, Ruby, Python, Perl, VBScript, PHP and JavaScript are some of the most commonly used Scripting languages. Considering that this scripting is usually used in combination with other programming languages, it is mostly found among HTML, Java or C++. A scripting language is a programming language which comprises a set of commands inside a file that can be performed without compiling. Scripting language can be classified in to server-side and client-side languages. Perl, PHP, and Python are perfect examples of the server-side scripting, whereas JavaScript is the most widely used client-side scripting language.  
            </p>
            
            <p class="lh-18" style="font-size:15px; font-family: 'q_serif',Georgia,Times,'Times New Roman','Hiragino Kaku Gothic Pro','Meiryo',serif;">Whereas a programming language is generally compiled first and then it is permitted to run, one command at a time is translated from the source code in case of scripting languages. While scripts are commonly used in the computer programming, they are becoming more frequently affiliated with the World Wide Web, in which they have been actively used to create complex Websites.</p>
            
            <p class="lh-18" style="font-size:15px; font-family: 'q_serif',Georgia,Times,'Times New Roman','Hiragino Kaku Gothic Pro','Meiryo',serif;"><b>Logic Programming Language</b><br>
            This kind of language enables programmers to offer declarative statements and then cause the system to argue the repercussions of those statements. In a way, a logic language does not tell the machine how to do a certain task, but rather it employs limitations on what could be done. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="lh-18" style="font-size:15px; font-family: 'q_serif',Georgia,Times,'Times New Roman','Hiragino Kaku Gothic Pro','Meiryo',serif;">This is a computer programming framework in which programming statements represent facts and rules concerning the issues in a framework of formal logic. Rules are expressed as logical clauses with a head and a body section while, facts are presented just like the rules, but without a body. </p>
            
            <p class="lh-18" style="font-size:15px; font-family: 'q_serif',Georgia,Times,'Times New Roman','Hiragino Kaku Gothic Pro','Meiryo',serif;">Our programming experts at a2z assignment help aim to provide complete knowledge and understanding to our students as part of your programming assignment help, regarding the various types of programming languages, so that they can get an insight into the key differences and opportunities offered by each of them.

This language allows programmers to coordinate a single program to various parts of a program, or use different parts on a single program. The object oriented framework also allows the code to be used multiple times, making C++ more efficient. This language has its critiques from various programmers, who argue the efficiency of C++.</p>
            <p class="lh-18" style="font-size:15px; font-family: 'q_serif',Georgia,Times,'Times New Roman','Hiragino Kaku Gothic Pro','Meiryo',serif;">Thorough understanding of the distinction amongst C-programming and C++ programming is crucial. C++ programming principles are based on objects oriented programming&nbsp;which are in and around data encapsulation concepts, polymorphism, data hiding, inheritance, abstraction&nbsp;etc. It is distinguished from the procedural or structural programming&nbsp;by the exclusive use of classes, methods and objects. It is compliant with most of the C language&nbsp;structure codes, as it is based on the core C programming controls. . C++ has more than 3000 online libraries with comprehensive library support.</p>
            <p class="lh-18" style="font-size:15px; font-family: 'q_serif',Georgia,Times,'Times New Roman','Hiragino Kaku Gothic Pro','Meiryo',serif;">You may check out our C++ programming assignment help samples on our website for reference, which will help you understanding its various concepts.</p>
