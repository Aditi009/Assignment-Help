                              Why are we Classified as Premium?
                         </h5>
                         <p>We, at a2zAssignmenthelp.com continuously strive to make our service better for the
                              students. To improve the user experience, we are introducing “premium” service for you.
                              This premium service is a refined facility through which the students can get more
                              opportunities and be entitled to various additional benefits. So, let’s say ‘Hello’ to the
                              brand new “Premium” service.</p>
                         <br>
                         <h5>5-Star Quality Writers</h5>
                         <p>In premium service, students get their assignments done by the best quality writers with
                              5-star ratings. These star ratings are cumulative average of the ratings awarded by the
                              students on the basis of the assignment quality. Generally, in most cases, the academic
                              writers with three and four star ratings are appointed to work on the assignments. The
                              5-star writers are saved for the complicated and high priority tasks.</p>

                         <br>
                         <h5>Manager’s Call Back For Rework</h5>
                         <p>Students, opting for premium service, will receive a call back from the relationship manager
                              within 12 hours of making a request for rework. A dedicated relationship manager treats
                              the task with priority and helps to create a perfect tailor-made assignment. In general
                              cases, students receive a call only if they put in a request for “call back” and the team
                              gets back in 24 hours time.</p>
                         <br>
                         <h5>Guarantee Rework Within 24 Hours</h5>
                         <p>Premium service guarantees the students rework within 24 hours. Every rework under premium
                              service will be given high priority and the changes will be made as per the discussion
                              with the student. In the standard service, the rework is done and delivered within 72
                              hours from the time of rework request.</p>
                         <br>
                         <h5>Facility Of Changing The Writer</h5>
                         <p>Students, availing the premium service, are free to put up the request for a new writer in
                              case they are not satisfied with the current writer, who's worked on his assignment.
                              Otherwise, no such request is entertained at a2zassignmenthelp.com. The students have to
                              deal with the current writer, though he can get the assignment customized and rework done
                              by the same writer, also, if a task if upgraded to premium only for the purpose of rework,
                              then the new expert shall work only on the modifications as per the feedback or
                              suggestions of the client</p>
                         <br>
                         <h5>Free Plagiarism Report</h5>
                         <p>In premium service, you can ask for and get plagiarism check reports from Plagiarism
                              Checking Tools or Software as and when you need them, that too absolutely free of cost.
                              All other clients have to pay $5.0 extra to avail the report to confirm the originality
                              and authenticity of the work (although all our works are original and free from
                              plagiarism).</p>
                         <br>
                         <h5>Quality Assurance Report</h5>
                         <p>Premium customers also receive a comprehensive quality assessment report of the assignment.
                              The report mentions all the requirements specified by the students and describes how the
                              concerned writer fulfilled the criteria. For non-premium customers, no such quality report
                              is provided.</p>

                         <br>
                         <h5>How To Avail This Premium Service?</h5>
                         <p>
                              It is true that all your assignments are urgent tasks; but these assignments should not
                              overwhelm you, debilitating your energy and affecting your academic performance. <br>
                              So take a little time, think twice or maybe thrice! Merely by paying a few extra bucks and
                              availing our premium service, you can choose to be bracketed among the “class” instead of
                              the “mass”. And most importantly, it'll help you save your precious time and energy. <br>
                              Remember, the normal service provides the standard facilities, whereas the premium service
                              provides the EXTRA benefits. And with the best and highest quality content, nothing less
                              than top grades await you!
