           <p class="assignmentfont">Since a law course, does not involve calculations or arithmetic’s, students are mostly graded on their, knowledge, retention, and analytical skills.

This preparation is done by students through, multiple hours of reading and analysis of different cases, in order to comprehend the minutest details of the case.

           <p class="assignmentfont">Along with the Case method, the law professors use one other method of teaching known as the Socratic Method. In this method, the teacher, evaluates how well a student has understood the details of the case by asking each student specific case related questions, and grading them in class. </p>
